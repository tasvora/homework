Observations
1) Temperature does increase at the equator, but it is noticed, that is not exactly at the equator 
but rather around the tropics, i.e., the areas that lie above and below the Equator.

2) Humidity and Cloudiness has no co-relation with respect to Latitude.
3) Wind speed appears to slightly increase as we move away from the equator.
